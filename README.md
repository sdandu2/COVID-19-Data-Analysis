# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis

This project examines global COVID-19 vaccination data to explore trends in vaccination rates and distributions across countries. Visualizations, including stacked area charts and heatmaps, highlight progress over time, focusing on countries with high vaccination rates.

## Project Overview
1. **Data Access**: Uses the Kaggle API to download and load COVID-19 vaccination data.
2. **Data Processing**: Handles missing values, converts dates, and aggregates data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Calculates key metrics like vaccination rate per hundred people.
4. **Visualization**: Creates stacked area plots, heatmaps, and line plots to explore trends by country and month.

## Usage
1. **Install Requirements**: Install necessary libraries with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
